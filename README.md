Boost your SEO rankings by automatically creating SEO-rich product image alternate tags with Magento 2 Image Alt Tags Extension.

Providing your customers with additional and alternate detail about the product image is known as Alt Tags. Alt tags are those informative pieces of content that provide the search engine crawlers with required and necessary information about the product image and list them according to the search query in the search engine result pages. Underestimating the importance of alt tags can adversely affect SEO rankings.

Robots and search engine crawlers do not have the ability to identify product images on website pages; it is the Alt tag that helps these bots identify the images.
